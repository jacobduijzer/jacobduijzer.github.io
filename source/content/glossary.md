# Glossary

Here is a list of word I have used in my blog posts. Actually it is just a way to play with one of the cool features of {term}`Sphinx`: a glossary.

```{glossary}

Arch Linux
    [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) is an independently developed, x86-64 general-purpose GNU/Linux distribution that strives to provide the latest stable versions of most software by following a rolling-release model. The default installation is a minimal base system, configured by the user to only add what is purposely required. 

BDD
    In software engineering, behavior-driven development (BDD) is an agile software development process that encourages collaboration among developers, quality assurance testers, and customer representatives in a software project. It encourages teams to use conversation and concrete examples to formalize a shared understanding of how the application should behave.

Gherkin
    [Gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/) is a business readable language which helps you to describe business behavior without going into details of implementation. It is a domain specific language for defining tests in Cucumber format for specifications. It uses plain language to describe use cases and allows users to remove logic details from behavior tests. 

SOLID
    [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) is an acronym for 5 important design principles when doing OOP (Object Oriented Programming). These 5 principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob), in his 2000 paper Design Principles and Design Patterns. The actual SOLID acronym was, however, identified later by Michael Feathers.

SpecFlow
    [SpecFlow](https://specflow.org) is a test automation solution for .NET built upon the BDD paradigm. Use SpecFlow to define, manage and automatically execute human-readable acceptance tests in .NET projects (Full Framework and .NET Core).

Sphinx
    [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org) is a tool that makes it easy to create intelligent and beautiful documentation.
