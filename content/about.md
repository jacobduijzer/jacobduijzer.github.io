# About 

Jacob Duijzer has been working as a software engineer since 1999 and worked for different companies all over the world. Professionally he is working mainly with the Microsoft stack (.NET, .NET Core, C#) and other technologies but he has a broad knowledge of other techniques too. Give him a new computer and the first thing he does is installing {term}`Arch Linux`. Even as a .NET developer he tries to develop as much as possible with a Linux machine rather than using Windows.

He likes to talk about technology, things like Clean Code, Clean Architecture, Domain Driven Design, design patterns, Unit and Integration testing, {term}`SOLID` principles. He reads a lot, both fiction and non-fiction, preferably one of each at the same time. He gets a lot of inspiration from podcasts, sites and books, below is just a short list of his most favorite sources of information.
